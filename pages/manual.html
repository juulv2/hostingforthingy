          so uhm where do i start i love you alot and i can be a bit much- i compliment and love you alot (no i dont do this as much to anyone else but u) becasue well no shit i really like or well love you (in a romantical way duh) and i like making you feel loved. Tho sometimes i dont really feel loved myself and say i love u a bunch in hope i get one back because i really like random affermation, reaffermation is something that rlly helps me

          <p class="bodyp">
           and please be open with me about ur struggles and things ur worried about, i love you so much and id just like to know how ur feeling- and i mean genuinly feeling. for example u didnt wanna tell me what u smoke, i just want to know because i care about u and i want to make sure its not something extremeley bad, not because i care that you smoke or well i do but more as in i dont want u to becasue its bad for you but yeah. And i just struggle a bit with feeling loved so i can be a bit extreme sometimes because i dont feel loved quickly i try to give alot of my love to others so theyll feel what i dont as much, and if im ever to much or if you ever want me to just be shush- you can tell me i wont mind i know i can be a bit much bahah
