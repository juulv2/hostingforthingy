           i think your genuinly one of the best people ive met whenever im talking with you it makes me so happy and even just thinking bout u makes me happy, i love your style so much its so unique and i love how ur not just some normal person whos super nonchalant i love that u show care- but only at special moments, i love ur humour i love so much about u its to much to name. idk maybe this website is a bit cringe or i may seem like idk, but i making this because i love you (this is the second time bc i also made the app version a while ago.....)

          <p class="bodyp">
            so i dont really want to talk about this but i think its important wheneve you speak to me less it does kinda hurt because well i really love u and i like you so yeah but i dont mind the fact u dont talk to me- its hard for me to get sudden changes without an expliantion or something like that. NOW OF COURSE I AM NOT BLAMING U I AM NOT MAD AT ALL IM SURE U HAD A GOOD REASON BUT I STILL THINK ITS GOOD THAT I GIVE U A HEADS UP ON WHY I MIGHT BE SCARED SOMETIMES
